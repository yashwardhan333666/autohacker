Lol, i guess you are human after all!!! Cool!!

Well, I'm Autohacker! I do not need your introduction. [because idc]



First time -

If you are running autohacker for the first time... I suggest you run "installer.py".
If you have an "expermien'ty" nature, you may have found out that autohacker MIGHT run for you even without installer.py. 
Without running the installer, there is a high chance program crashing errors. 
So, just to be safe nonetheless, run installer.py


Also, Keep this in mind -> "pinky promise". 
You will need it to prove that you are a GOOD human being! ;)



Not first time -

If this is not your first time, then you can directly run autohacker.py.
